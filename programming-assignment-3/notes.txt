Introduction:
-Kind of PA1 with multithreading

Client
-need to join() threads after making them

Datamsg:
-create p-threads to produce Datamsgs
-create w FIFOs for workers to use
- create w-threads to consume and process Datamsg
    -> worker threads produce result of process Datamsgs
-create h-threads to consume results and populate HG

Histogram uses mutex to avoid race conditions

File Transfers:
-collect file size
-create a thread to produce filemsgs
-create w-threads to consume and process file msgs
    -> use fseek to write to file (open mode important)

Bounded Buffer:
-STL queue with objects vector<char>
-use a mutex and cond var
    -> mutex is wrapped in a unique_lock
-push waits on size < cap; notify pop that data is available (cond var)
-pop waits on size > 0; notify push that slot is available (cond var)
